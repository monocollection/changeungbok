24 Season Color Palette contains  Chang’s photographs of nature recorded over 10 years. The "colors" have been extracted from the photographs to create color palettes, and  Chang’s own patterns were then matched with the colors and images of nature. The book is divided into 24 seasons of the year, and each season is divided into three sections according to texture so as to form 72 distinct categories. The last part of the book  shows the entire set of color palettes from No. 1 to 100, and the 72  categories organized to function as indexes through references at the bottom of each page. As  Chang notes, the book will be of great help not only to students and researchers in the textile field through "systematically designing nature's rhythms and patterns," but also for contemporary people in general because “the measure of beauty can teach us how to look at nature more deeply and regain our own special aesthetic tastes."
