RICE PAPER CABINET    
1020 x 500 x 1400(h)mm / Wood, Rice Paper, Print Silk Fabric

Chang Eungbok is inspired by the Joseon Dynasty, and uses hanji, linen, and silk on a wooden frame to communicate the splendor of harmony in a minimal way.

Chang’s cabinets have a variety of functions, such as a wardrobe, a cupboard, or even a piece of sculpture. In this case, Chang based her pattern on the French Rococo style  of the eighteenth century, which was printed on Korean paper to the  interior and exterior of the cabinet.
