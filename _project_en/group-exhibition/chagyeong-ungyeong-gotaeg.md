<u>The House of WoonKyung</u>

The historic ‘House of WoonKyung’ is the traditional Korean house where Lee Chai Hyung(former Speaker of the National Assembly) lived from 1953 until his death in 1992. It is located at the foot of Inwang Mountain, to the northwest of The Blue House.

Built on the site known as Dojeong-goong(one of the Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty), it is where DukHeung Daewon-gunlived, whose third son became the King Seon-jo,14th King of the Joseon Dynasty.WoonKyung(pseudonym of Lee Chai Hyung), a descendant of King Seon-jo, bought the house in 1953, following the Korean War, recognizing that it had nearly 400 years long familyties to his ancestors.

The house is comprised of three parts: ‘An-chae’ (inner quarter for the family) and ‘Sarang-chae’ (outer quarter for men),and ‘Haengrang-chae’ (women’squarters), with a small Oriental pond between the outer and inner quarters. With the ‘GeongGooDang’signboard,meaning ‘Carrying on the old ancestralheritage and further development of their teachings’, hanging above the main entrance to Sarang-chae, the outer quarter, the house was frequented by many politicians and leaders of the country from the time of the enactment of the Democratic Constitution of Korea until recently.
