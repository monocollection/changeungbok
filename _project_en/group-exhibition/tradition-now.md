‘HOUSE-HOUSE’    
A space filled with New Year wishes.

Through announcing the beginning of Lunar New Year in 2024, ‘HOUSE-
HOUSE’ is designed to evoke the values of traditional culture.

The universe (宇宙) unites infinite space (‘宇’) and time (’宙’) and includes
all things. But the spaces that define our lives are all too often built with
the cold and alienating geometric forms of modern architecture. Chang
Eungbok, the Director of the exhibition, transforms Culture Station Seoul
284 into a House that employs warm and dynamic geometric forms which
reflect the values of traditional culture while also being inspired by
contemporary architectural and environmental forms. Through using the
materials, forms, and structures of traditional culture, ‘HOUSE-HOUSE’
signals the happiness and peace we desire at the beginning of the Lunar
New Year, and is connected to the next space, ‘ROOM-ROOM’ - a space
within a space.

.

‘ROOM-ROOM’    
Warm-hearted scenes from daily life.
An architecture and design that connects space to the universe evokes

the substance and spirit that joins the ‘House’ to the ‘Room’. ‘ROOM-
ROOM’ realizes Korean-style living by adding warmth to the precious

goods of daily life. It is arranged as a place to enjoy daily life, defining,
intensifying, and concentrating our state of mind.
Our lives are led in accordance with the flow of nature and time, such as
the traditional seasonal customs, the 24 solar phases, the four seasons,

etc., and these overlap in the spaces of ‘HOUSE-HOUSE’ and ‘ROOM-
ROOM’, bringing a new experience of the warm-hearted ambience of

traditional life and culture.
