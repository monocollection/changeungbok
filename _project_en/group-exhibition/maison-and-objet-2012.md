MONO COLLECTION’s philosophy is Soft Design and Living. Inspired by Korea’s rich cultural heritage, but also by an understanding of contemporary needs, MONO COLLECTION advocates the flexible, modular interior, in which all elements harmonize and are easy to install and maintain. MONO COLLECTION creates an intimate and sensual ambiance within organic and fluid spaces, where ch’i energy freely circulates and life slows down. MONO COLLECTION employs specially sourced textiles, papers and woods, and uses both traditional and state-of-the-art methods of production.
