Fabric is a material that is closely related to our body, and depending on
its use, we first communicate with it through the sense of touch. Clothes
are like a house or a vessel that contains the human body.
The feeling that arises from sensing within clothes an object of comfort
and protection is created by experiences accumulated over many
generations. For those of us living in modern times, the memories of
such experiences are fading, and in the wake of industrialization, we are
losing the sense of feeling with our hands, our eyes, our hearts, and with
energy.

I have been working with the public for a long time, applying the material
properties of fabric I use in spaces and architecture to hanbok. Although
hanbok is still practical for major events, various functions need to be
added so that we can wear and live in hanbok today. My activities began
working with the artist Kim Dong-yul and they have been recorded for
the past 10 years by photographer Kim Young-il.

It is not only the visual elements that structure the experience of clothes.
This experience happens through the intimate activities of daily life, such
as sleeping, walking, working, cooking, eating, and studying.

As living environments change, hanbok is also changing in response to
people's activities.

I am working to place hanbok on the contemporary body.
