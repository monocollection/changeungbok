Wayuru

The exhibition space, which unfolds like a landscape painting, expresses Korean cuisine and living space in a flexible and enjoyable way. Within, all the works are inspired by nature, and each object is designed to display various forms and rhythms, depending on the space and on the person who uses them. In addition, the designer intended to respect traditional methods through not only the choice of fabric but also the method of working with the various materials, while  at the same time also adapting them to the modern context.

The space on the left represents the restrained natural spaces of the landscape tradition of  mountain-and-water, while on the right the space expresses a harmonious and more visually powerful sentiment.

The textiles were made of the designerâ€™s unique colour and patterns sense  and often contain stories within them from our past to the present. Various materials, such as paper, wood, glass, iron, lacquer, and hanji paper, were also used for household items and accessories.
