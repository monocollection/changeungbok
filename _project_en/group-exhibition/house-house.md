The universe (宇宙) unites infinite space (‘宇’)  and time (’宙’) and includes all things. But the spaces that define our lives are all too often built with the cold and alienating geometric forms of modern architecture. Chang Eungbok employs warm and dynamic geometric forms which reflect the values of traditional culture while also being inspired by contemporary architectural and environmental forms. Through using the materials, forms, and structures of traditional culture, ‘HOUSE-HOUSE’ is connected to the next space, ‘ROOM-ROOM’ -  a space within a space.
