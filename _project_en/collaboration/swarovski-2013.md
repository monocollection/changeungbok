SWAROVSKI TREND 2013 COLLABORATION    
DESIGNER: CHANG Eungbok

Modern materials were used to harmonize curtains and furniture utilizing crystal fabric to produce a modern sense within a contemporary space. The contrast in textures, blending modern Korean style with tradition, is very pleasing.

1. Watching Flowers
Jung Yak Yong's poem was applied in crystals to a  silk cushion.

2. River Fish
Crystal covered fabric in the rhythmic  silhouette shape of my river fish.

3. Dinosaur Egg Cushions
These dinosaur egg shaped soft sculpture-cushions  were inspired by Bogildo's famous ‘dinosaur’ giant pebble Beach. Fish made in Crystal fabric were added.

4. Wind Chime
Decorated with crystal elements on a soft wind-bell, made of engraved fabric and up-cycle leather work.
