In the reception area, you can see furniture created in collaboration with artist-designer Chang Eungbok based on traditional Korean household items, such as ji-chang (paper cabinets) nested in the wall.
During the Joseon Dynasty, the rooms of nobility were decorated with simple furniture, such as display cabinets, writing tables, and wooden folding screens. A common subject for folding screens was   the chaekgado.
Chaekgado is a specific genre of painting that originated in the Royal Court, where the composition is centered on books and bookshelves. It reflects the spirit of the Korean people who highly valued and prized learning.
As our ancestors did, Studio Writers appreciates the value of continuous learning, and we try to create from a base of accumulated wisdom. We believe this chaekgado pattern best reflects our attitude.  You will be able to see a modern version of this chaekgado at Naro. It is printed on hanji (Korean traditional paper) lining the insides of the paper cabinets.

The gentle rhythm of the meok (traditional Korean ink) waves imparts energy to the space.
The design created by artist-designer Chang Eungbok is heavily inspired by the great Joseon painter Jeong-seon (1676-1759) and his landscape painting Tong-cheon-moon-am-do.

On the ceiling is Chang’s modern version of the Cheon-sang-yeol-cha-boon-ya-ji-do , a celestial map from the Joseon era renowned for its astronomical accuracy. 
One important feature of the map concerns the 24 jeol-gi (Korean seasons). Koreans have traditionally divided the year into 24 seasons, depending on the relative positions of the earth, moon and sun. Our ancestors used jeol-gi to dictate Korean food culture - from agriculture to seasonal dishes.
