Swarovski Trend 2011 Collaboration

Using the Mono Collection concept of ‘mountain-water,’ I made works inspired by traditional motifs in the painting of Kang Jung Jeon, a representative painter of Joseon scholar painting, using  digital printing and Swarovski Elements.

1. Longing Geunggang Mountain

3. River Fish
