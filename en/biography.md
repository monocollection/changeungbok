***CHANG EUNGBOK***

In 1986, designer Chang Eungbok opened her first shop, Mono, in Seoul, which was changed to Mono Collection in 1993. Since then, Chang has established a strong presence in textile and interior design in both Korea and abroad. She is recognized for her unique ability to blend traditional Korean motifs with stunningly original designs, and for her use of well-established and innovative techniques. Though her work is rooted in textiles, she also creates furniture and ‘soft interiors’, or non-standardized living spaces that are highly evocative and sublimely restrained.

She has designed for hotels in South Korea, Vietnam, Morocco, and China, and for restaurants and private residencies throughout South Korea. Mono Collection participated in Heimtextil (2000-2001) and Maison & Objet (2012).

Chang has exhibited her work in art galleries internationally, including the Mori Museum, Tokyo (2005) and Seoul Museum of Art (2013). She also worked with Roche Bobois in France (2008-2009), and designed a highly successful bedding line for CJ Korea (2011-2013).
